# PAM MCP server

PAM 0.4.0 ships an optional MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes
the memory store as typed tools to any MCP-capable agent host. The portable
markdown + JSONL contract is unchanged; the server is purely additive runtime.

## What you get

The server runs locally over stdio (no network, no daemon, no port) and exposes
15 tools under the `pam` namespace:

- `pam_version`, `memory_state`, `maintenance_config`: context tools
- `memory_list`, `memory_read`, `memory_search`: safe filesystem reads under `memory/`
- `graph_query`, `graph_stats`, `graph_validate`, `graph_reindex`: graph tools
- `memory_audit`: hygiene checks, returns findings
- `memory_propose_edit`: records a proposal artifact under `memory/maintenance/proposals/`; never mutates the target file
- `memory_append`: appends a dated section to a managed log; refuses unmanaged paths
- `memory_apply_proposal`: applies a previously-recorded proposal after re-validating against current content; archives the artifact
- `maintenance_run`: wraps the maintenance CLI (defaults to dry-run)

Write paths through the server are bounded:

- `memory_append` only writes to paths declared in `config.managedLogs`
  (typically `memory/knowledge-log.md` and `memory/conversation-log.md`).
- `memory_apply_proposal` only writes to whatever target a previously-recorded
  proposal already passed through the safety validator at propose time, and
  re-validates everything (protected paths, drift, graph integrity) before
  applying.
- `graph_reindex` writes only the derived `memory/graph/catalog.json`.
- `maintenance_run` is gated by `config` and defaults to dry-run.

There is no path to write to `memory/agent-memory/`, `memory/sources/`,
`AGENTS.md`, or `CLAUDE.md` through any MCP tool. Those paths are protected.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18 or newer (already required by PAM's existing tools).
- An MCP-capable host: Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, OpenClaw, or any other
  client that speaks MCP over stdio.

## Verify the server starts

From the repo root:

```bash
npm run mcp:smoke
```

The smoke run prints two JSON-RPC frames (initialize result and tools/list
result) and exits 0. If it errors, fix the workspace before configuring a host.

## Host configuration

### Claude Code

Add to project `.mcp.json` (preferred) or `~/.claude/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pam": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["tools/pam-mcp-server.mjs"],
      "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}"
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Code, then run `/mcp` to confirm `pam` is connected.

### Cursor

Add to `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (resolve `cwd` to an absolute path):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pam": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["tools/pam-mcp-server.mjs"],
      "cwd": "/absolute/path/to/your/repo"
    }
  }
}
```

### Codex CLI

Add to `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.pam]
command = "node"
args = ["tools/pam-mcp-server.mjs"]
cwd = "/absolute/path/to/your/repo"
```

### OpenCode / OpenClaw

Point your MCP host configuration at `node tools/pam-mcp-server.mjs` with `cwd`
set to the repo root. The exact config file location depends on your client.

## Tool naming across hosts

Each host prefixes MCP tools with the server name. Claude Code surfaces them as
`mcp__pam__memory_audit`, `mcp__pam__graph_validate`, and so on. Cursor and
Codex use similar prefixes. The unprefixed tool name within the server is
always one of the 15 listed above.

## Workspace selection

By default the server resolves the workspace as the directory containing
`tools/pam-mcp-server.mjs` (i.e. the PAM repo root). To target a different
workspace, pass `--workspace <path>`:

```bash
node tools/pam-mcp-server.mjs --workspace /path/to/other/repo
```

The host config's `cwd` field is the simplest way to do this in practice.

## Limitations

- stdio transport only (no HTTP/SSE/WebSocket).
- No streaming notifications, no cancellation.
- One-file-per-call for `memory_propose_edit`; diffs are capped at 64 KB.
- Symlinks are refused for every file operation.

The transport is hand-rolled (zero new dependencies). If a future host requires
features we don't support, falling back to `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` is a
one-file change in `tools/lib/mcp-transport.mjs`.

## Safety surface

`memory_propose_edit` is the only tool that produces an artifact intended for
review. It rejects, with a clear error message:

- paths matching `config.protectedPaths` (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `memory/agent-memory/`, `memory/sources/`);
- paths that resolve outside the workspace;
- symlinks;
- multi-file diffs;
- diffs over 64 KB;
- unified-diff hunks whose `before` doesn't match current content;
- JSONL edits whose result fails `validateGraph`.

Proposal artifacts are JSON files under `memory/maintenance/proposals/`.
Applying a proposal is a manual step that the human takes after review,
typically via `memory_apply_proposal` below.

## Write tools

### `memory_append`

Inputs:

- `log` (required): the managed log to append to. Match on
  `config.managedLogs[].archiveKey` (preferred, e.g. `"knowledge-log"`) or
  `.source` (e.g. `"memory/knowledge-log.md"`).
- `headerTitle` (required): the title portion of the new section header. The
  server constructs the full header as `## YYYY-MM-DD - <headerTitle>`.
- `body` (required): markdown body of the new section.
- `date` (optional): ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`. Defaults to today UTC.

The server rejects:

- logs not declared in `config.managedLogs`;
- empty `headerTitle` or `body`;
- headers that don't match `## YYYY-MM-DD - <title>`;
- malformed `date` strings;
- missing target files (no auto-create);
- symlinked target files.

Inserts the new section immediately after the file's intro prefix and before
the first existing dated section (newest-first ordering).

### `memory_apply_proposal`

Inputs:

- `proposalId` (required): the id of a JSON artifact under
  `memory/maintenance/proposals/<id>.json`.

The server:

1. Loads the proposal.
2. Re-runs the same safety checks `memory_propose_edit` ran at propose time
   (protected paths, workspace escape, symlinks).
3. Re-applies the diff against the *current* target content. If the file has
   drifted since the proposal was recorded (`before` no longer matches, or
   unified-diff hunks don't align), apply is rejected and the artifact is
   untouched.
4. For JSONL targets, runs `validateGraph` on the proposed result.
5. On success, writes the new content, renames the artifact to
   `<id>.applied.json` with `appliedAt` and `status: "applied"` added.

Drift detection is intentional. A proposal that fails apply is a signal that
the target changed since review; re-run the curator, get a fresh proposal,
re-review, then apply.

## Uninstall

Remove the host config entry. No state remains outside `memory/maintenance/`,
which you can keep or clean up at your discretion.
